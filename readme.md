## Electrical Market Analysis - README

This project analyzes a dataset on electrical vehicles (EVs) to understand market trends and consumer preferences. 

**Data Cleaning:**

* Missing values were identified and rows containing them were dropped to ensure data consistency.

**Analysis Steps:**

1. **EV Adoption Over Time:**
    * Visualizations will explore the number of EVs registered by model year, revealing growth patterns in the EV population.

2. **Top EV Counties:**
    * The top 3 counties with the highest EV registrations will be identified.
    * Distribution of EVs within the cities of these counties will be analyzed.

3. **EV Types:**
    * The breakdown between different EV types, such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), will be explored to understand market composition.

4. **EV Popularity by Manufacturer and Model:**
    * This analysis will identify dominant manufacturers and specific models in the EV market.
    * Insights into consumer preferences at the brand and model level will be revealed.

5. **Electric Range Analysis:**
    * The electric range (distance traveled on a single charge) of EVs will be explored.
    * This analysis is crucial for understanding market size and consumer needs.

6. **Trends in Electric Range:**
    * We will investigate how electric range has changed over model years, highlighting advancements in battery technology and vehicle design.

7. **Electric Range by Manufacturer and Model:**
    * This section will compare electric ranges among the top manufacturers and models.
    * It will reveal how different manufacturers prioritize range and identify models with superior capabilities.
